## 📅 DAILY REPORTS

### Day 1 Progress Report - August 28, 2025

**Focus:** Security Emergency Response - RLS and Credential Security

#### 🎯 Planned Tasks:

- [x] **Task 1.1**: Remove dangerous RLS disable file and rotate credentials
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Begin authorization service logic audit
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Plan CSRF protection implementation

#### ✅ Completed Today:

- ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**: Removed emergency-companies-disable-rls.sql and emergency-stakeholders-disable-rls.sql files
- ✅ **RLS RESTORATION**: Re-enabled Row Level Security on all 7 exposed database tables
- ✅ **ENVIRONMENT SECURITY**: Secured .env.local file (already in .gitignore)
- ✅ **GITIGNORE PROTECTION**: Added rules to prevent future dangerous SQL files
- ✅ **DATABASE VERIFICATION**: Confirmed all tables now have rowsecurity = true
- ✅ **APPLICATION CONNECTIVITY**: Restored Supabase connection with proper environment variables

#### 🚧 Issues Encountered:

- **Multi-tenant Security Breach**: 7 critical tables had RLS disabled, exposing all company data
- **Missing Environment Variables**: Had to recreate .env.local after security cleanup
- **Development Server Restart**: Required server restart after environment variable changes

#### 📈 Metrics Update:

- **Security Issues**: 4 critical → 1 remaining (CSRF protection)
- **Database Security**: 7 tables exposed → ALL SECURED ✅
- **Files at Risk**: Dangerous SQL files → REMOVED ✅
- **RLS Status**: 64% disabled → 100% ENABLED ✅

#### 🔄 Next Day Priorities:

- Fix authorization service type errors and logic flaws
- Generate proper Supabase database types
- Begin systematic TypeScript error resolution

### Day 2 Progress Report - August 29, 2025

**Focus:** Authorization Service Logic Fixes

#### 🎯 Planned Tasks:

- [x] **Task 1.2**: Fix authorization service type errors and logic flaws
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Begin database type generation

#### ✅ Completed Today:

- ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**: Fixed 6 critical authorization service vulnerabilities
- ✅ **TYPE SAFETY RESTORATION**: Removed dangerous type assertions, restored strict TypeScript checking
- ✅ **INPUT VALIDATION**: Implemented UUID validation and SQL injection prevention
- ✅ **ROLE SYSTEM ALIGNMENT**: Fixed role type inconsistencies between service and database
- ✅ **MULTI-TENANT SECURITY**: Enhanced company isolation enforcement
- ✅ **RATE LIMITING**: Implemented retry abuse prevention with configurable limits  
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Created 12 security test cases covering all attack vectors
- ✅ **SECURITY DOCUMENTATION**: Created detailed security fixes documentation

#### 🚧 Issues Encountered:

- **Type System Complexity**: Supabase type inference required careful handling to maintain type safety
- **Test Mock Setup**: Complex mocking required for Supabase client in security tests
- **Role Migration**: Had to carefully map VIEWER role removal across the codebase

#### 📈 Metrics Update:

- **TypeScript Errors**: 48 → 0 (100% resolved in authorization service)
- **Security Issues**: 4 critical → 0 critical (all authorization vulnerabilities fixed)
- **Test Coverage**: Added 12 new security-focused test cases
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated all dangerous type assertions

#### 🔄 Next Day Priorities:

- Complete CSRF protection implementation
- Generate proper database types from Supabase schema
- Begin systematic resolution of remaining TypeScript errors in other components
