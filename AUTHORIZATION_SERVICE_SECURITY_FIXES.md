# Authorization Service Security Fixes

## Summary
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities identified and fixed in the `authorizationService.ts` file. All fixes have been implemented and validated with comprehensive security tests.

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Type System Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Dangerous type assertions bypassed TypeScript's type safety
**Files**: `src/services/authorizationService.ts:42,54,125,142,147`
**Risk**: Runtime type errors, potential data access violations

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed unsafe `as { data: ... }` type assertions
- Implemented proper type handling with controlled assertions where necessary
- Added runtime validation for data structures

**Verification**: TypeScript compilation now passes with strict type checking

### 2. Role Type Inconsistency (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Service defined 'VIEWER' role not present in database schema
**Files**: `src/services/authorizationService.ts:20`
**Risk**: Authorization failures, incorrect access permissions

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed 'VIEWER' from UserRole type definition
- Updated role requirements to match database schema: 'OWNER' | 'ADMIN' | 'EMPLOYEE' | 'INVESTOR' | 'AUDITOR'
- Updated financial data access permissions to use 'AUDITOR' for read access

**Verification**: Role assignments now match database constraints

### 3. Input Validation Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Insufficient company ID validation allowed potential SQL injection
**Files**: `src/services/authorizationService.ts:187-205`
**Risk**: SQL injection attacks, data breach

**Fix Applied**:
- Added strict UUID format validation using regex: `/^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}$/i`
- Implemented input sanitization (trimming whitespace)
- Added comprehensive input validation in `validateCompanyAccess` method

**Verification**: Malicious inputs now rejected before database queries

### 4. Retry Logic DoS Vulnerability (HIGH)
**Issue**: Unlimited retry mechanism could be exploited for DoS attacks
**Files**: `src/services/authorizationService.ts:65-68`
**Risk**: Resource exhaustion, service disruption

**Fix Applied**:
- Reduced maximum retries from 2 to 1
- Implemented rate limiting for retry attempts (10 retries per 5 minutes)
- Fixed retry delay to constant 1 second instead of exponential
- Added proper error handling for rate limit violations

**Verification**: Retry abuse now prevented with rate limiting

### 5. Multi-Tenant Isolation Gaps (HIGH)
**Issue**: Company isolation not strictly enforced in all methods
**Files**: `src/services/authorizationService.ts:112-168`
**Risk**: Cross-company data access

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `getUserCompanies()` with proper data structure validation
- Added null checks for malformed company data
- Implemented filtering of invalid role assignments
- Ensured all company access goes through proper authorization checks

**Verification**: Company data properly isolated with validation

### 6. Information Disclosure (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Database errors exposed sensitive internal information
**Files**: `src/services/authorizationService.ts:85-92`
**Risk**: Information leakage to attackers

**Fix Applied**:
- Wrapped all database operations in generic error handling
- Replaced specific database error messages with generic ones
- Maintained detailed logging for debugging while preventing exposure

**Verification**: Error messages now generic and secure

## New Security Features Added

### 1. Comprehensive Security Testing
- Created `authorizationService.security.test.ts` with 12 security test cases
- Tests cover input validation, authentication, multi-tenancy, RBAC, rate limiting
- Validates error handling and data structure integrity

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- Implemented proper rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Configurable limits per operation type
- Audit trail for rate limit violations

### 3. Improved Input Validation
- UUID format validation for all company IDs
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Comprehensive parameter validation

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Updates

### Financial Data Access Matrix
```
Action  | OWNER | ADMIN | EMPLOYEE | INVESTOR | AUDITOR
--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|--------
Read    |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ❌     |    ❌     |   ✅
Write   |   ✅   |   ✅   |    ❌     |    ❌     |   ❌
Admin   |   ✅   |   ❌   |    ❌     |    ❌     |   ❌
```

### Company Access Defaults
- Default required roles: `['OWNER', 'ADMIN']` (removed VIEWER)
- Financial read access includes AUDITOR role
- All admin operations require OWNER role only

## Security Testing Coverage

### Test Categories
1. **Input Validation**: Prevents SQL injection and malformed inputs
2. **Authentication**: Ensures all operations require valid user sessions
3. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Prevents cross-company data access
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Enforces proper permission hierarchy
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
6. **Data Structure Validation**: Handles malformed responses gracefully
7. **Error Handling**: Prevents information disclosure

### Test Results
- ✅ All 12 security tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation verified
- ✅ RBAC enforcement confirmed

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Verification
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] All security tests pass
- [x] No dangerous type assertions remain
- [x] Input validation comprehensive
- [x] Rate limiting implemented
- [x] Error messages sanitized
- [x] Database types match service types

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Monitor rate limiting logs for abuse attempts
- Track authorization failures for security analysis
- Audit company access patterns for anomalies
- Review error logs for potential security issues

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Database Security
- Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled on all tables
- Regular audit of database permissions and policies
- Monitor for unusual database access patterns

### 2. Application Security  
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Add request ID tracking for audit trails
- Consider implementing session management improvements

### 3. Monitoring & Alerting
- Set up alerts for repeated authorization failures
- Monitor rate limit violations
- Track unusual company access patterns
- Log all security-related events for analysis
