# Security Policy

## Overview

The Cap Table Management Platform is designed with enterprise-grade security principles to protect sensitive financial and equity data. This document outlines our security model, compliance features, and vulnerability reporting process.

## üîí Security Model

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Complete Data Isolation**: Each company's data is completely isolated through PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Tenant-Aware Queries**: All database queries automatically filtered by company context
- **Secure Session Management**: JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh mechanics
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system with principle of least privilege

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **Data in Transit**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Data at Rest**: Database encryption using industry-standard AES-256
- **Sensitive Fields**: Additional encryption for PII and financial data
- **Key Management**: Secure key rotation and management practices

#### Access Controls
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions with audit trail
- **Session Security**: Secure cookie settings with httpOnly and secure flags
- **Password Policies**: Configurable complexity requirements and rotation

### Infrastructure Security

#### Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-enforced multi-tenancy
- **Connection Security**: SSL-only database connections
- **Query Validation**: Parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted backups with secure storage

#### Application Security  
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection plus additional sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks

### Audit & Monitoring

#### Audit Trail
- **Complete History**: Every data modification logged with timestamp and user
- **Immutable Logs**: Tamper-evident audit logging
- **Data Lineage**: Track changes across related entities
- **Export Capabilities**: Audit logs available for compliance reporting

#### Security Monitoring
- **Real-time Alerts**: Suspicious activity detection and alerting
- **Access Monitoring**: Failed login attempts and unusual access patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and resource usage tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Management

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:

#### Contact Information
- **Email**: security@captable.dev
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 24 hours
- **Updates**: Regular updates provided throughout investigation process

#### What to Include
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected systems
- **Supporting Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof of concept (if safe)

#### What NOT to Include
- **Do not**: Access or modify data belonging to others
- **Do not**: Disrupt service availability or performance
- **Do not**: Publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we've had time to address them
- **Do not**: Use automated scanners without permission

### Security Response Process

#### Timeline
1. **24 Hours**: Initial acknowledgment and triage
2. **72 Hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
3. **7 Days**: Detailed investigation and impact analysis
4. **14 Days**: Fix development and testing (for high-severity issues)
5. **30 Days**: Public disclosure coordination (if applicable)

#### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to data integrity or system availability
- **High**: Significant security impact or data exposure risk
- **Medium**: Limited impact or requires specific conditions
- **Low**: Minimal impact or theoretical vulnerabilities

### Bug Bounty Program

We appreciate security researchers who help improve our platform security:

#### Eligible Vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or privacy violations
- SQL injection or code injection attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Cryptographic vulnerabilities

#### Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to user devices
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services we don't control
